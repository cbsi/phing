i## Phing and Phoenix for Jenkins

This repo holds a composer build of Phing and Phoenix for Jenkins (it is not a fork of Phing as the name might imply). It exists to provide a fixed location that Jenkins can find the configuration and code it needs to operate. Jenkins expects it to be deployed to util58.phx2:/cbs/home/gamespot/phing.
